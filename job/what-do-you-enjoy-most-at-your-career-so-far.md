# What Do You Enjoy Most at Your Career so Far

In my current job, I am a member of a five-person team, and we work together on a variety of large-scale projects where each of us is responsible for one part of the project. I really enjoy the teamwork aspect of the job and like seeing how all the pieces of our projects came together in the end. The teamwork aspect of this job is something that greatly appeals to me because I typically end up learning a lot about what I’m capable of when working with others.
